Hey there, I'm Hannah. 

In the past I've gone through Code Lou programs and enjoyed them, but didn't have any solid end goals. I was hoping to land a remote job, then continue to learn from there. At that time I had neither the best tools nor any direction, and all the options in the tech world had me overwhelmed. 

Since my last stint at coding- I've attempted to go back to school for a biology degree, as I fell in love with ecology, virology, and learning about the natural world in general on a deeper level. But really, to get into any of those fields you need tons of schooling. And honestly, the pay at the end of all that work is not great in today's world. 

But what I found in researching jobs in those fields is that they need data analysts- and that's something I do have at least a bare minimum of experience in AND I enjoy learning about. So here I am, back at it again but with a much clearer drive in mind.
