Hey there, I'm Hannah. 

In the past I've gone through Code Lou programs and enjoyed them, but didn't have any solid end goals. I was hoping to land a remote job, then continue to learn from there. At that time I had neither the best tools nor any direction, and all the options in the tech world had me overwhelmed. 

Since my last stint at coding, I've been working at a company that's gotten me to realize that I actually I enjoy work that challenges me mentally. Each project has it's own set of perameters and issues that I need to work through, and thinking of each one as a new puzzle has allowed me to enjoy my job in a way that I didn't expect from myself before. 

In that time I also attempted to go back to school for a biology degree, as I fell in love with ecology, virology, and learning about the natural world in general on a deeper level. But really, to get into any of those fields you need tons of schooling. And honestly, the pay at the end of all that work is not great in today's world. 

What I found in researching jobs in those fields though is that they need data analysts- which I believe is a career that both my current skill set along with my love of problem solving lends itself to. So here I am, back at it again but with a much clearer drive in mind.
